1,Bauer_internationalorganizations.pdf,"The topics that we cover in this class are often difficult, not just intellectually but emotionally. While I expect there to be rigorous discussion and even disagreement in the course of our class discussions, I ask that you engage in discussion with care and empathy for the other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. In this class we will not shy away from the uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing assumptions and basic values is not just one of our tasks in this course but is an activity vital to living an authentic life. I urge you to have the courage to the uncomfortable in this class. In exchange for your courage, I will work to ensure a classroom environment that supports your taking these intellectual and sometimes emotional risks.",GRAD-C3-1101,Bauer,Harry,Male,Quali,Social science,"Power, Samantha. 2001. ‘Bystanders to genocide’.

I have passionately fostered cultural exchange through my long standing position as coordinator of the student exchange program between Kiel University in Germany and the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. Through this program I was able to send German students to experience their study abroad in the United States and had the honor to host American students of multiple ethnic backgrounds at Kiel University.
