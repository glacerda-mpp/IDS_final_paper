Learning Objective       In the last session, we return to arguments made at the very beginning of                          our course. What challenges do international organizations face in the                          21st century? What innovative forms of global governance are we seeing                          in the 21st century? Will there be an environment for international                          organizations to thrive in for the foreseeable future and what do we know                          about their ‘death’?
