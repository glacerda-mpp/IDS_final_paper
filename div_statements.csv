"1","Bauer_internationalorganizations.pdf","The topics that we cover in this class are often difficult, not just intellectually but emotionally. While I expect there to be rigorous discussion and even disagreement in the course of our class discussions, I ask that you engage in discussion with care and empathy for the other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. In this class we will not shy away from the uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing assumptions and basic values is not just one of our tasks in this course but is an activity vital to living an authentic life. I urge you to have the courage to the uncomfortable in this class. In exchange for your courage, I will work to ensure a classroom environment that supports your taking these intellectual and sometimes emotional risks."
"2","econIIeconomiccrises_Ahrens.pdf","I celebrate diversity in my everyday life through my friends, my colleagues and co-authors, my profession, and the team that teaches this class. I have always taken a multinational and multicultural perspective. I believe that diversity fosters the inventiveness of thought, generates mutual understanding and respect, and is an enrichment to personal experience. I have passionately fostered cultural exchange through my long standing position as coordinator of the student exchange program between Kiel University in Germany and the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. Through this program I was able to send German students to experience their study abroad in the United States and had the honor to host American students of multiple ethnic backgrounds at Kiel University. During my own studies abroad at the University of Illinois, I was also a member of the international student organization International Illini of the University of Illinois."

"4","econIIsustainability_Lancker.pdf","In my lectures, I strive to support inclusivity and diversity, and to build a culture where difference is valued, discussed, and finally spurs innovation and learning. I appreciate feedback on these issues, and would be honoured if you would address to me any issues you experience with discrimination, offensive speech or related issues during lecture or labs."
"5","globalgov_Patz_Rev.pdf","All participants in the course—lecturer and students alike—commit to using a respectful and inclusive language aware of racism, sexism, ableism and other forms of discriminatory speech. Students are invited to indicate the names and pronouns with which they (do not) want to be addressed. The reading materials in this course are broadly gender-balanced and include texts authored by non- Western scholars but otherwise reflect the existing bias in “global” and English-language academic publishing on global governance and International Relations. Where possible, postcolonial and Global South perspectives are included in the materials used. Students are encouraged to bring in further perspectives, notably where they have language and area skills to access non-English and less visible scholarly work or empirical insights."

"7","international_law_CaliCostello.pdf","The course aims to serve students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives. It draws on examples, cases and institutions across the globe and suggests readings from a diversity of perspectives on international law. We invite all our students to engage in discussion with care and empathy for the other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. It is our intention that students’ learning is addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. We intend to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups."
"8","introduction_to_economics_Bosch-Rosa.pdf","This class will try to cover topics beyond the usual curricula in introductory economics. We will do so by having a session dedicated exclusively to the problems of gender and racial discrimination. We also will try to provide the widest range possible of examples while covering all other topics. You are encouraged to send any ideas or topics that you think should be included in the class."

"10","NOinternationalsecurity_Gohdes_Wucherpfennig.pdf","As you may know, the Hertie School is committed to implementing a new Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.                                                       In the spirit of this vital commitment, we emphasize that in this course, each voice in the classroom has something of value to contribute to all discussions. Everyone is expected to respect the different experiences, beliefs and values expressed by fellow students and the instructor. We expect you to engage in reasoned discussion that refrains from derogatory comments about other people, cultures, groups, or viewpoints."
"11","NOlawgov_Dawson-Kurban-Thielbörger.pdf","Given the extensive geographic diversity of our student body, the course takes general international law as its starting point while drawing on examples from different national/regional legal orders. Comparative insights and analogies to different legal and political systems are welcome and encouraged. As discussed under participation below, the socratic method of teaching requires respectful and active discussion among the group as a whole – as instructors, we will make strong efforts to encourage wide and balanced participation and encourage students to also support and be respectful of the diverse views and backgrounds of course participants."

"13","policyprocessclimate_Hickmann_Fuhr.pdf","We intend that students in this course who come from diverse backgrounds will be treated equally with the highest level of respect and fairness. The different perspectives that students bring to this class will broaden our horizons and enrich discussions. The available literature, material presented and class activities will be conducted in ways that are respectful of gender, sexuality, disability, age, status and culture. Student suggestions for improving inclusiveness of our course are encouraged and appreciated."
"14","policyprocesseduclaborecon_Graf.pdf","The goal of this course is to provide an open, inclusive, and creative learning environment. The diversity that students bring to this course, primarily through their case studies, is viewed as a resource and benefit. It is my intention to present content and activities that are respectful of diversity. Your suggestions to include more diverse content in the literature are appreciated. Students are encouraged to not only take advantage of the opportunities that diversity brings to our classroom but also to learn from the insights and ideas shared by other students."
"15","policyprocesseu_Migliorati.pdf","This is a course focused on the European Union, hence it is necessarily centred on western European politics and policy making. Nevertheless, the course is meant for anyone who is interested in having a practical understanding of the working mechanisms of such a complex institution, regardless regional origin and culture. Moreover, through the assignments, the course offers the possibility to “impersonate” both non-governmental actors and governmental ones in several policy areas. This gives students the chance to choose what interests they seek to represent according to their aspirations and identity."
"16","public_mgmt_hustedt.pdf","The instructor attaches great importance to diverse and inclusive discussions, and group works to which all students contribute and participate. It is important that everybody feels safe to contribute freely. The instructor will address the significance of an inclusive class atmosphere in the first session. In terms of course structure and content, the course takes the key state of the art concepts of PA scholarship as its starting point and will apply them to different cases and examples from around the globe. Students are encouraged to contribute examples based on their backgrounds. The instructor has broad experience in comparative PA research and in working with governments from different parts of the world which also serves to provide examples from different cases. Last but not least, group works will - occasionally - work with fictional cases that could travel across real- world country cases."
"17","public_mgmt_Parrado.pdf","Given the broad experience of the instructor working with governments of different parts of the world, his examples include experiences from Latin American, Asian and Eastern European countries. Moreover, examples from countries with different majoritarian religions are included."

In the choice of course readings, we strive to cover authors with a diversity of backgrounds as far as possible. During class sessions, I seek to create a trusting and inclusive atmosphere that allows students of all orientations and backgrounds to be comfortable and openly engage in discussions. The R community lives these values and I want you to become part of it. If you have any suggestions that contribute to this goal, I am always grateful for feedback."
